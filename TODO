Some random notes below...

having a second user of a GitHub client begs some interesting
questions for reuse. It would seem that in both the findowners work
and in the Tracker annotation work that we're really only interested
in actions against the repository so maybe it's best to remove
the raw "client" interface and expose more interesting actions
that can be narrowly consumed downstream e.g.

```
type Repository interface {
	// some interesting getters
}

type Comment interface {
	Body() string
}

type Issue interface {
	Description() string
	Comments() []Comment
}

type IssueFetcher interface {
	FetchIssues() ([]Issue, error)
}
```

creating a client will likely involve specifiying the repo and
some secret for connecting but that messiness could probably be
hidden in someone's main() :)

A Client knows how to support interesting interactions with the GitHub API
